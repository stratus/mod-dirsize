                                   ---------------------

Introduction
------------

It's an apache module in early stages of development that helps you 
calculating the disk space used for each VirtualHost, based of course
on its DocumentRoot. The result is in kb and XML.


Roadmap
-------

March/April
mod_dirsize 0.2 - Apache 2 support
                  Better debug output
		  W3C HTML and XML if possible

May/June
mod_dirsize 0.3 - Remove ap_bspawn() call adding better code to 
                  calculate the space used.


Configuration
-------------

To include this module in your server, follow the steps below:

    1. Install the module in /usr/lib/apache/1.3/ or your apache 
       libraries directory (if you are unsure search for mod_env.so).

    2. Place the configuration line below into your /etc/apache/modules.conf 
       (Debian) or together with Module or AddModule directives in your own
       Apache configuration file.

       For Apache 1.2: Module dirsize_module      <libraries_dir>/mod_dirsize.so
       For Apache 1.3: LoadModule dirsize_module  <libraries_dir>/mod_dirsize.so
      
    3. Reload your Apache (/etc/init.d/apache reload), check if it was really
       reloaded (look at your global log files).

    4. Add in your Apache configuration file, outside any <VirtualHost> directive:
       
       <Location /dirsize>
          SetHandler mod_dirsize
       </Location>

    5. Reload your Apache again doing the same sanity checks.
       
    6. Go to your web browser and check http://hostname/dirsize . You can do
       http://anyvirtualhost/dirsize too!


Security
--------
    
The <Location> directive above do not set any authentication for that 
url. You can restrict the access in many ways, the simplest is a ip 
based authentication:

<Location /dirsize>
   SetHandler mod_dirsize
   order deny,allow
   deny from all
   allow from <paste your ip here>
</Location>   
    
You must change <paste your ip here> for anything valid, of course.


Notes
-----

You are free to change <Location /dirsize> for <Location /anything> if 
you want, but the "SetHandler mod_dirsize" must be untouched.
