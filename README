                                   -----------------

Introduction
------------

mod-dirsize is a module for Apache 1.x to calculate the disk space used by each 
VirtualHost based on its DocumentRoot. The result is given in kb encapsulated 
in a valid XML file.


Roadmap
-------

mod_dirsize 0.2 - Apache 2 support
                  Better debug output
		  W3C HTML and XML if possible

mod_dirsize 0.3 - Remove ap_bspawn() call adding better code to 
                  calculate the space used (a "libdu" would be awesome).


Configuration
-------------

To include this module in your server, follow the steps below:

    1. Install the module in /usr/lib/apache/1.3/ or your Apache 
       libraries directory (if you are unsure search for mod_env.so).

    2. Place the configuration line below into your /etc/apache/modules.conf 
       (Debian/Ubuntu) or together with Module or AddModule directives in your own
       Apache configuration file.

       For Apache 1.2: Module dirsize_module      <libraries_dir>/mod_dirsize.so
       For Apache 1.3: LoadModule dirsize_module  <libraries_dir>/mod_dirsize.so
      
    3. Reload your Apache (/etc/init.d/apache reload), check if it was really
       reloaded (ie.: look at your global log files).

    4. Add in your Apache configuration file, outside any <VirtualHost> directive:
       
       <Location /dirsize>
          SetHandler mod_dirsize
       </Location>

    5. Reload your Apache again doing the same sanity checks.
       
    6. Go to your web browser and check http://hostname/dirsize . You may want to 
       do http://anyvirtualhost/dirsize as well.


Security
--------
    
The <Location> directive above does NOT set any authentication for that 
URL. You may restrict the access by yourself! I recommend something like IP 
based authentication as follows:

<Location /dirsize>
   SetHandler mod_dirsize
   order deny,allow
   deny from all
   allow from <paste your ip here>
</Location>   
    
Please note you must change <paste your ip here>.


Notes
-----

You are free to change <Location /dirsize> for <Location /anything> if 
you want, but the "SetHandler mod_dirsize" must be untouched otherwise it won't work.
